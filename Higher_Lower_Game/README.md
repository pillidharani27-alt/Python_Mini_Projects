# Higher Lower Game

This is a simple Python mini project where the player guesses which option has the higher value.  
It helps me practice Python basics like loops, conditionals, functions, and random module.

## 🎯 Game Idea

- The game shows two options (for example: A and B).
- The player must guess which one has the higher value (score / number / followers etc.).
- If the guess is correct, the score increases and the game continues.
- If the guess is wrong, the game ends and the final score is shown.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Language: Python
- Topics used: `if-else`, `while` loop, functions, random values, print formatting
