Python Mini Projects

A collection of beginner-friendly Python projects created while learning the fundamentals of programming.
These mini-projects focus on logic building, functions, loops, conditionals, and problem-solving.

🧩 Projects Included
1️⃣ Hangman

A word-guessing game where the player tries to guess letters while avoiding too many wrong attempts.

2️⃣ Guess the Number

A simple game where the computer picks a number and the user tries to guess it with hints.

3️⃣ Coffee Machine

A simulation of a coffee machine where the user selects drinks, resources are checked, and money is processed.
