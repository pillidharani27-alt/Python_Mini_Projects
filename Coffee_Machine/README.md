☕ Coffee Machine Project

A Python-based simulation of a simple coffee vending machine.
This project demonstrates key programming concepts such as functions, loops, dictionaries, conditional logic, and resource management.
It forms a strong foundation for understanding real-world machine logic and user interaction flow.
